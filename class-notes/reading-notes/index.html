  <h4>A friend is writing</h4>
  <p>
    This site makes me think a lot about the patterns in dark UI/UX â€“ constant things popping up on the screen, dinging, popping into your vieew, confusing and overwhelming you. The notification counter just goes up and up, making it feel like you'll never catch up. It's a great representation of why I stray so far from a lot of social sites, it feels like theyre constantly overwhelming me, so it's easier to stay away that fall prey to it.

  <h4>A rant about technology</h4>
  <p>
    I think the distinction between what is and isn't technology is a really interesting thing to bring up. Nowadays when people think of technology, they think of electricity, computing, metal and steel and wires, but technology can be anything that is a tool or requires some sort of knowledge to create. It's something that we don't consider often enough nowadays.

  <h4>A handmade web</h4>
  <p>
    Honestly I've grown to love handmade web making so much that it makes me never want to use a CMS and just always make my own. There is a certain touch that handmade webs have that I think a lot of CMS sites lack, the little bit of human error, the human touch rather than just corporate blockiness. As much as I love a well made and stunning interactive site, there's something about doing it myself that's far more satisfying.

  <h4>The good room</h4>
  <p>
    His personal technological profile makes no sense to me, it feels arbitrary in nature honestly. But I think it's interesting how he points out that some of the most addictive sites are also the ones that make their users the most unhappy and dissatisfied.
